# Taskit-mobile-project
To do list flutter application 
Taskit is a Flutter-based to do list mobile application that helps users stay on track with their tasks and complete them on time by reminding them by sending  a notification. Additionally, the use of gamification should increase usersâ€™ interaction. Gamification is implemented in Taskit by counting points for each completed task, and the higher the score, the more badges the user gains.
